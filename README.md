# Priority_Time_Queue
If you want to run locally then => Clone Project, do npm install then npm start.

data.csv contains input data.

Time_to_expire has been treated as the start time. It is assumed in the project that the burst time for each task is negligible so many tasks can be completed in 1 second parallelly. So if there are 3-4 tasks with same start times then we will choose order based on priority.
